[unreleased - most recent changes come first]
---------------------------------------------

üöÄ Features
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Lower down the exhaustiveness as it takes unecessarily long. -
   (`dbb8aae <https://github.com/Isra3l/MolSanitizer/commit/dbb8aaeb1d9ba8450f7221ecc9f69817d163990a>`__)
-  Now support enrichment mode, not putting the db2 files into db2.tgz.
   Maily for adapting with the internal enrichment pipeline. -
   (`004af69 <https://github.com/Isra3l/MolSanitizer/commit/004af6938faef4507ee9c32f7229e78471e73b88>`__)
-  Trial of new stochastic sampling method that involved in increased
   sampling but keeping the failure count continously increase without
   being resetted after every good conformer. This shown a 2X
   performance on a small tricky subset. -
   (`b5f8e32 <https://github.com/Isra3l/MolSanitizer/commit/b5f8e32d1608dc9de3e8ca7be67014f6e7691465>`__)
-  SMILES is now back to the DB2 format! -
   (`0da0468 <https://github.com/Isra3l/MolSanitizer/commit/0da04682d7cea4588945ee4fddaf5e8f1fb4ff16>`__)
-  New implementation of stochastic sampling that can sample more
   exhaustively the conformational space. This involves sampling more
   and filter later at the end. Msani now doesn‚Äôt write out and read in
   intermediate files repeatedly but process in the memory to speed up
   the process. -
   (`6edbfad <https://github.com/Isra3l/MolSanitizer/commit/6edbfadda576db3c4b819e88aa7881615fb84847>`__)
-  The default maximum stereoisomers to be expanded is now set to 8
   (previously 32). This could always be set specifically by flag
   ‚Äìmax_isomers. -
   (`536f5fe <https://github.com/Isra3l/MolSanitizer/commit/536f5fe94af181e32a9d5b3ad7d54f11061b61df>`__)
-  Log files and input files now being organized to corresponding
   folders. New cleanup mechanism for msani_batch. -
   (`16c7f11 <https://github.com/Isra3l/MolSanitizer/commit/16c7f111b43f67c7ec3b60844f89723a55180382>`__)
-  DB2 files now are put in tar.gz by default. The number of files in
   each tar.gz depends on the number of lines per job. -
   (`dbd74a4 <https://github.com/Isra3l/MolSanitizer/commit/dbd74a42537fed8c4e123f1f255b3debbd57d958>`__)

üêõ Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The recent increased sampling seems to run too long on some case
   examples. This was the case of very flexbile but contain multiple
   repulsive parts. The current implementation should sampling faster
   for these cases. -
   (`aed5d98 <https://github.com/Isra3l/MolSanitizer/commit/aed5d98369b116d8a084b01b8cd735802a45e2d7>`__)

   Mol2 objects are now deepcopy to avoid referencing issues. -
   (`58a0815 <https://github.com/Isra3l/MolSanitizer/commit/58a081580eea581081b963e6b4512553a2a7eeac>`__)

   -
   (`f1f82b7 <https://github.com/Isra3l/MolSanitizer/commit/f1f82b7b7705b1bb5e32a3624fa7890e49b5a773>`__)

‚ö° Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Modifications to mol2db2 allows the mol2 object being recorded
   on-the-fly rather than reading from the mol2 blocks. OpenBabel is now
   only being used for the initial conversion for AMSOL. -
   (`65eed12 <https://github.com/Isra3l/MolSanitizer/commit/65eed12479d9d31fc11eeb31d0b40061f59fab5a>`__)

~~~~~~~~~

-  Solv files are now deleted even the nocleanup is used. The .solv file
   is still exist in the db2 folder if the user want to check for the
   partial charges and desolvation penalties. -
   (`b99efdf <https://github.com/Isra3l/MolSanitizer/commit/b99efdf80ef94561b591f4b8bbd4bb107c33e8e8>`__)
