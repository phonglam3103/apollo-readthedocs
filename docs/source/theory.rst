SMARTS reactions
----------------

SMARTS reactions are used for assignning charges, adding hydrogens, and removing salts. The following SMARTS reactions are used in MolSanitizer:


Conformational sampling
-----------------------

Unlike the traditional conformational sampling algorithm of UCSF DOCK, which is a systematic torsional scan based on JChem, CORINA, and OMEGA, MolSanitizer uses RDKit to generate conformers. The conformers are generated by sampling the torsional angles of the rotatable bonds. The number of conformers is controlled by the user
